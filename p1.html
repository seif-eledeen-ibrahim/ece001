<h2>The name indicates what the database is. A database is one of the essential components for many applications and is used for storing a series of data in a single set. In other words, it is a group/package of information that is put in order so that it can be easily accessed, manage, and update.There are different types of databases. They are:

  <ul>Bibliographic</ul>  
   <ul>full-text</ul> 
   <ul>numeric</ul> 
   <ul>images</ul> 
    In a database, even the smallest portion of information becomes the data. For example, a Student is a data, a roll number is a data, and the address is data, height, weight, marks everything is data. In brief, all the living and non-living objects in this world are data. In this chapter of the database, you will learn about the fundamental terminologies that are used in DBMS.</h2>
